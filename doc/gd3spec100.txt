GD3 v1.00 tag spec:
The GD3 tag is a bit like an ID3 tag only used for games.
All values are written in Intel byte order.
The GD3 tag begins with a "Gd3 " string.
Next four bytes are the version number (current is 0x00,0x01,0x00,0x00)
Next four bytes are a 32-bit length of the following data in bytes.
The following data is a series of null-terminated strings of this form:

"Track name (in English characters)\0"
"Track name (in Japanese characters)\0"
"Game name (in English characters)\0"
"Game name (in Japanese characters)\0"
"System name (in English characters)\0"
"System name (in Japanese characters)\0"
"Name of Original Track Author (in English characters)\0"
"Name of Original Track Author (in Japanese characters)\0"
"Date of game's release written in the form yyyy/mm/dd, or just yyyy/mm or yyyy if month and day is not known\0"
"Name of person who converted it to a VGM file.\0"
"Notes\0"

NOTE that two bytes are used to store every character, even English characters.
The null terminators are two zeros.
e.g. 0x54 0x00 0x72 0x00 0x61 0x00 0x63 0x00 ... 0x00 0x00
New-line characters should only be in the notes field,
where they are represented by 0x00 0x0a only.
You can write 16-bit strings in Visual C++ like this:
unsigned short *MyString=L"Track name";

If a field in not used or unknown, it should be a empty string (i.e. two zero bytes
for the null terminator).

Be careful to include the system name in a standard form.
Here are some standard system names:
"Sega Master System"
"Sega Game Gear"
"Sega Master System / Game Gear"
"Sega Mega Drive / Genesis"
"Sega Game 1000"
"Sega Computer 3000"
"Sega System 16"
"Capcom Play System 1"
"Colecovision"
"BBC Model B"
"BBC Model B+"
"BBC Master 128"

Keep spelling, spacing and capitalization the same.

Note that the "Original Track Author" might be the composer, arranger, programmer
or any combination of these.
